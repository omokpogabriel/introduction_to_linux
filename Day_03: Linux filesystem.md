# FILE SYSTEM
  Everything in the Linux system can either be a process or a file. A file can be media, actual file, directory, etc
> The Linux file system under root can be summarized as ["the linux file system"](https://prnt.sc/DB1e0mCwTRw4).
  * use <code> df -h </code> to view the file system
  * to view the files in lets say a usb, run <code> ls /media/the location </code> . ths location can be gotten from using the df command
