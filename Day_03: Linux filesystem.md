# FILE SYSTEM
  Everything in the Linux system can either be a process or a file. A file can be media, actual file, directory, etc
> The Linux file system under root can be summarized as ["the linux file system"](https://prnt.sc/DB1e0mCwTRw4).
  * use <code> df -h </code> to view the file system
  * to view the files in lets say a usb, run <code> ls /media/the location </code> . ths location can be gotten from using the df command
  *   

> / is the root directory of the Linux system and this is when all sub directories including external devices are mounted/accessed. th display the file system, run <code> df -h </code>. 

## FILE SYSTEM HIERARCHY
  This Linux file sytem hierarchy is:
  / - this is the root direcory
  /bin & /sbin - These directories contains commands such as the ls, file, cim, sudo, e.t.c this directories contaisn all the commands you run in the system
  /var - this directory contains log files and tmp temporary files which can either be generated by the system or by the user
  /usr - this contains the system users. it is the Users directory in MAc
  /home or ~ : This contains the files of a current user
  /etc - contains the configuration for installed applications and system applications
  /media - contains mounted devices
  /lib - contains library files used by different application. the package manager manages this file itsef
  /opt
  /mnt - it's like media but is used for floppy disk
  /boot - contains files needed for the system to boot
  /dev - this contains device files for every othe device attached to the system such as teh harddisk or cdrom
  /proc - contains information about the system resouces such as the cpu, memory, etc.
  /run - this is a tmp system that runs in ram. this directory is used by the system and the contents will disappear on reboot

  ## ABSOLUTE VS RELATIVE PATH
  > The absolute path is preceeded by a / in the path name while a relative path is preceded by a ./ or ../ in the path name

  ## LS COMMAND
  this command is used to list the files in a directory. eg ls [path1], [path2]
  Options:
  * -l: displays the list of the content of a directory include information like priviledges, owner, timestamp of each of the contents
  * -ld: displays information about the direcgory itself and not its contents
  * -a: Displays all files including hidden files 
  * -S: sort by size
  * -h: shows file size in human readable format
  * -X: is used to sort by extension
  * to hide a certain extension for the result run <code> ls --hide=*.conf </code> where .conf is the extension we want to exclude
  * -R : list files recursively

  > <code> du -sh [destination] </code> shows the actual size of a file


### ASSIGNMENT
Go through the man page of the ls commnad and write out atleast 40 commands, reciting and remembering them for this new week
