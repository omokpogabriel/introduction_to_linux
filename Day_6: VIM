## VIM
VIM is a command lint text editor that is widely used. it is gotten from the default vi which was used in the first linux distribution.
VIM has 3 modes:
1. command mode: This is the default mode in vim. while in default mode, every character is taken as a command. for instance, typing E makes the cursor move to the end of a line. to enter this mode press the <code> esc </code> button
2. Insert mode: this is the mode where you enter your text. to enter this mode press the <code> i </code> button
3. last line mode :  this is the mode where the cursor move to the last line of the page. ener this mode with the <code> : </code>, enabling you to run commands such as :wq

use <code> vimtutor </code> to access the vim tutorial from the shell

### VIM short cuts:
* E -> move the cursor to the last line in insert mode
* A -> move the cursor to append new text in insert mode
* o -> move the cursor to the next line
* O -> move the cursor to the previous line 
* I -> move the cursor to the beginning of the line
* x -> used to delete a character
* dw -> used to delete a word
* d$ -> deletes from the position of the cursor to the end of the line
* [integer]w -> move the cursor a certain number of time like the tab key in windows
* 0 -> move the cursor to the start of the line
* :q! -> quit vim without saving
* :w! -> save without quitting vim
* :wq -> same as zz, it saves and quit vim
* J -> used to delete white space
* r -> used to enter the replace move
* :%S/find_word/replace_with_word/g : this command will replace the "find_word" with the replace word
* :/[search_word] -> used to search the occurence of a word from top down
* :?[search_word] -> used to search a word bottom to top . use n to find next and N to find previous
* :[integer] -> move to a particular line number
* dd -> used to cut
* y -> used to copy
* u -> used to undo (same as crtl +z in windows)
* p -> used to paste before the cursor
* P -> used to paste after the cursor
* v -> is used to highlight a word, V used to highlight several lines, crtl +v used to select rectangle lines. this is call VISUAL MODE
* :set nu -> used to show line numbers
* :set nonu -> used to turn of line number
* :syntax on -> used to turn on syntax highlighting
* :syntax off -> used to turn off syntax highlighting
* :set ic : ignore case
* :set hls : highlight all matching phrase
* :set is: show partial matching for a search phrase
* [integer]dd -> used to cut a certain number or line from the cursor
* CTRL + G -> shows your location
* gg -> used to move to the beginning of the file
* G -> used to move to the end of the file
* [integer]G -> move you to a particular line
* :next -> used to move to the next document when vim -o file1 file2 was used to open the present file
* :prev -> used to move to the previous document when vim -o file1 file2 was used to open the present file
* ctrl + o -> takes you back to where you where before the last command and ctrl + i does the opposite


use vim -d file1 file2 to open 2 files to comapre them. them use ctrl +w to navigate either of the file.

<code> vim ~/.vimrc </code> any command saved here will persist.

if you have a swap issue, do a rm on the swap and you will be fine
